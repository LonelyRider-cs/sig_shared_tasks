Languages
=========

We initially provide data for 10 languages:

1.  Armenian (`arm`)
2.  Bulgarian (`bul`)
3.  French (`fre`)
4.  Georgian (`geo`)
5.  Hindi (`hin`)
6.  Hungarian (`hun`)
7.  Icelandic (`ice`)
8.  Korean (`kor`)
9.  Lithuanian (`lit`)
10. Modern Greek (`gre`)

We will announce an additional 5 "surprise languages" just before the conclusion
of the task.

Using the baselines
===================

[`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html)
is recommended for a reproducible environment. Once you have conda installed,
create a new conda environment by running this:

``` {.bash}
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

The new environment is called "task1". Activate it by running this:

``` {.bash}
conda activate task1
```
