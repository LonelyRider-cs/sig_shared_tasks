Transformer baseline
==================================================

This directory contains a Transformer baseline, similar to that used by Vaswani et al.Â (in press).

To run:

1.  Enable the Conda environment as described in [`README.md`](../../README.md)
2.  Run [`preprocess`](preprocess).
3.  Run [`sweep`](sweep). This may take a while.

When the sweep is complete the results are stored in the
[`dev-scores/`](dev-scores/) directory.
